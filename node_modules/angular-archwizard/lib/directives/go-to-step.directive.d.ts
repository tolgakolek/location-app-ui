 *
 * With absolute step index:

 * ```html
 * <button [awGoToStep]="{ stepIndex: absolute step index }" (finalize)="finalize method">...</button>
 * ```
 *
 * With unique step id:
 *
 * ```html
 * <button [awGoToStep]="{ stepId: 'step id of destination step' }" (finalize)="finalize method">...</button>
 * ```
 *
 * With a wizard step object:
 *
 * ```html
 * <button [awGoToStep]="wizard step object" (finalize)="finalize method">...</button>
 * ```
 *
 * With an offset to the defining step:
 *
 * ```html
 * <button [awGoToStep]="{ stepOffset: offset }" (finalize)="finalize method">...</button>
 * ```
